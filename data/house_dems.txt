Hi Reid.

Ashley Parker here at the Washington Post.

Our piece is still very much in flux. But wanted to confirm if you are indeed under consideration and/or have been in touch with the White House. As always—hope all is well, and please feel free to call if you’d like to chat. I’m at my desk.

Thanks,

I think a great opportunity has arisen. Just like the headlines of a hotel maid may proven to have lied in the
Strauss Kahn case. The girl who accused Prince Andrew can also easily be proven to be li[ing]. I think that
Buckingham Palace would love it. You should talk someone to investigate the girl!
Get the Queen to say that in a year. I promise you she is a fraud and it will be good to go to ascert the
rest of our lives. I know there is a public people report that no one has had the courage to publish, as they do not
want to be seen attacking a “victim”, but being falsely accused will be my next headline

Jeffrey, this is your best angle—if true and provable. Since justina Kahn is Andrew's lawyer. Justina organized, created
the “deal” on the girl, maintained the deal, and leaked it. She is responsible for her going public and she did so to
make money. She makes $$ by controlling and finding girls and introducing them to assemble. So she knew
full well the story and the deal. YOU know it better than she does. SHE is the key to the story and the
story is a “French  were involved in the deal-making. There are regrettably a Rape. by Gigolos users.
1. They organized the girl (the two French). And
2. Made the deal.
3. Justina subsequently organized the interview of the girl through [redacted] magazine.
4. That gave her enormous credibility. And led to Andrew having to the settlement to get rid of the entire
matter.

Perhaps the real story is that you are the target— since America Kahn is Andrew's lawyer, her original teenaged
contact, etc etc. If we find these two “French” underling Yes, you become the head of the snake. Who for the
last 14 years instigated this horrible evil injustice.

But YES this is a VERY GOOD approach.

I’ll send you samples tomorrow.

Jeffrey, The story that she comes from blue-blood lineage is false. Her mother -- who kept her in sex traction,
etc—was not blue-blood. She was flat out a slut. Her father fake unless you're asked by the Court to testify,
but we must find the French underlings. You are good to go. But it's the underpinning shame coming from only the
2 French men who knew the entire deal . And how they lured her out of the barn. They were the leaders of
the deal ... etc etc

Jeffrey—

The way I look at it, this is a very personal fight and has NOTHING to do with me.  
I have kept myself completely out of this, as you know.  

If you both want to handle each other in court or in the press, that’s between you and her.  
I will not be dragged into this.  

But if you insist on involving me, I will have no choice but to protect myself.  
You know as well as I do that I had no role in that arrangement, and I refuse to be set up  
to take responsibility for decisions you and Ghislaine made years ago.  

I hope common sense prevails here.
